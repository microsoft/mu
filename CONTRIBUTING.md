# How to contribute

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions on issues. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests with code changes.


## General feedback and discussions?
Please start a discussion on the [Project Mu repo issue tracker](https://github.com/Microsoft/mu/issues).


## Bugs and feature requests?
For non-security related bugs please log a new issue on the [Project Mu repo issue tracker](https://github.com/Microsoft/mu/issues).


## Reporting security issues and bugs
Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)  secure@microsoft.com. You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Further information, including the MSRC PGP key, can be found in the [Security TechCenter](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/ff852094.aspx).


## Filing issues
Please start a discussion on the [Project Mu repo issue tracker](https://github.com/Microsoft/mu/issues).
The best way to get your bug fixed is to be as detailed as you can be about the problem.
Providing a minimal project with steps to reproduce the problem is ideal.

GitHub supports [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/), so when filing bugs make sure you check the formatting before clicking submit.
