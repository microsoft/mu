# Building

The central build component for Project Mu is found in Mu Basecore. It is in the UefiBuild Python module in the UefiBuild directory. The easiest way to invoke the builder for testing is the leverage the CoreBuild script located in the same directory (NOTE: This functionality is being restored to work with the new structure of Project Mu. Stay tuned for updates.)

More info to come. We hope to soon release a reference project that will provide a more concrete example of how to integrate the Project Mu build system with any UEFI project.
