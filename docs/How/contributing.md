# How to contribute

There are three common ways to contribute.

1. Participate in discussions using GitHub issues.
1. Contribute documentation by opening a GitHub Pull Request.
1. Contribute code by opening a GitHub Pull Request

## Filing Issues

File a GitHub issue in the corresponding Project Mu repository.

### General feedback and discussions

If the feedback is actionable, such as a feature request, file a feature request issue. Otherwise, start a new
thread in the GitHub Discussions section of the corresponding Project Mu GitHub repository.

### Bugs and feature requests

For non-security related bugs, please submit a new issue in the Project Mu GitHub repository that contains the code
related to the issue.

The best way to get your bug fixed is to be as detailed as you can be about the problem. Providing a code snippet or
sample driver that exposes the issue with steps to reproduce the problem is ideal.

### Reporting security issues and bugs

Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)
<secure@microsoft.com>. You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up
via email to ensure we received your original message. Further information, including the MSRC PGP key, can be found
in the [Security TechCenter](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/ff852094.aspx).

## Contributions of Documentation and/or Code

### Pull Requests

If you don't know what a pull request is read this article: <https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests>.
Make sure the repository can build and all tests pass. Familiarize yourself with the project workflow and our coding
conventions.

### General workflow

1. Fork Repository in GitHub
2. Make desired changes.
3. Build it, test it, document it
4. Submit a Pull Request back to the development branch you would like to target.
5. You will be asked to digitally sign a CLA
6. The server will run some builds and tests and report status
7. Community and reviewers will provide feedback in the Pull Request
8. Make changes / adjust based on feedback and discussion
9. Keep your PR branch in-sync with the branch you are targeting and resolve any merge conflicts
10. Once the the PR status is all passing it can be squashed and merged (just press the button in the PR).  If the PR
    is ready the maintainers may complete it for you.

That is it.  Thanks for contributing.

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  Most (code and documentation) contributions require you to agree
to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit <https://cla.microsoft.com>.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.
