# Steps for a New Integration

## Overview

In Project Mu, any time we snap to a new commit from our upstream project, [Tianocore](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2),
we call that an Integration. This usually happens when Tianocore releases a new stable tag, but it can happen at other
times, as needed.

Below, you will find a checklist of the steps that should be followed by any project maintainers when performing a new
upstream integration. This is for reference by the maintainers and by any of the community interested in the process.

We will do our best to keep this up to date, so it's an excellent reference for what to expect if you're waiting on an
integration.

## 1) Announce

Advertise the upcoming update, where it will start from, how long it will take, and what will happen with the existing
release branch afterwards. This should be done in the [Release Announcements](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a2fcb1744302e4cd28b5a7e9d46479ca8%40thread.skype/Release%2520Announcements?groupId=6ba27a5b-86b2-4dc2-9d74-a8d8a03c3c3f&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47)
channel in the Project Mu Team.

## 2) Rebase and Test

Much of this process is designed to be run on every Mu repo. When deciding which repos to update first, refer to the CI
dependencies documented in each repo. [See here](https://github.com/microsoft/mu_basecore/blob/ce3097e7de6f44f6788b96f7f2dae7c863d44a89/.pytool/CISettings.py#L155)
for an example.

### a) Prep for the Naive Rebase

* Create `rebase/*_naive` branch by starting at the very tip of the current (latest) release branch
  * There may be reasons to choose a commit other than the very tip, but this is the default
* Update the readme with new branch info and update all CI badges to look for the new branch
  * Make sure to update source and destination commits
  * When selecting the destination [upstream] commit...
    * For `mu_basecore`, this will _tend_ to be the latest stable tag (e.g. `edk2-stable202111`), but
      that's not always true. Make a selection based on the state of `edk2` and the requirements of
      Mu
    * For other repos, generally you want to pick the exact same commit as `mu_basecore`. If not, you should
      probably make a note about why in the Readme
* Check all tools and other dependencies (probably only in `mu_basecore`) to see whether they make sense to move forwards,
  including...
  * pip modules in `pip-requirements.txt`
  * markdownlint-cli
  * cspell
  * nasm
  * ACPI tools
  * etc.
* Sync the Azure pipelines, pip, gitignore files, configs, and other docs with `mu_basecore`. Try to keep things consistent
  where possible
  * Easiest way to do this is just a Beyond Compare with Basecore and look at the `.azurepipelines` and `.pytool`
    directories, as well as the `pip_requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, `RepoDetails.txt`, and `Readme.rst` files
  * There may be other files that need to be checked as well

### b) Perform the Naive Rebase

NOTE: This process will not be followed the same way on "pure Mu" repos such as `mu_plus`.
For each repo, _refer to the Readme for any special maintenance instructions_.

* Work through the Naive Rebase
  * Make sure to pay attention to any "TCMORPH" commits and whether any new packages/files/submodules need to be dropped
  * Make sure to drop any new `.pytool/Plugins` that may have been added to other repos that are only needed in
    `mu_basecore`. Some plugins may have been added by the upstream project, but most plugins should only live in
    `mu_basecore`
* Keep notes of any major conflicts/sightings, how they were resolved, and any follow up steps that may be needed

### c) Clean the Rebase

This is an optional -- though desirable -- step where we have the opportunity to squash small bugfixes, drop
temporary/testing commits, update features with new testing requirements, and any other behavior that helps keep
the history clean and readable.

* Create `rebase/*_1` branch and perform initial cleaning
* Repeat with as many new cleaning branches as necessary
  * Always diff with the `rebase/*_naive` branch to ensure changes are understood
* Create the `rebase/*_staging` branch when complete

### d) Prepare for Testing

* Tag the branch as `*_Rebase` and push tag to remotes
  * NOTE: From here on out, you can only perform a rebase _above_ the `*_Rebase` tag

### e) Take care of binary deliverables (`mu_basecore`)

* Disable the ext deps for [BaseTools](https://github.com/microsoft/mu_basecore/blob/release/202008/BaseTools/Bin/basetoolsbin_ext_dep.yaml)
  and Crypto
* Run the BaseTools release pipeline
* Trigger the actual release once the build passes
* Tag the commit that these were released from
* Update the Basetools version and re-enable the extdep
* [See here](https://www.tianocore.org/edk2-pytool-extensions/features/extdep/) for more
  details

### f) Run Testing

* Repeatedly run the PR gate or CI pipelines (_must_ use the pipelines on the servers) and resolve build
  issues as they emerge
  * Each issue should be solved in it's own commit and include an update to the Readme with details and potential
    follow-up actions

### g) Clean Up

* Confirm all CI Build notes were updated in the Readme
* Tag as `*_CIBuild` and push to all remotes
  * NOTE: Again, from here on out we can only rebase _above_ this tag
* Create `release/*` branch in all repos and push branch to remotes
  * From now on, fixes will have to come through PRs

## 3) Boot a Reference Platform

Once rebase has been completed on all repos...

* On a reference platform, create a new branch for integration testing
* Pivot all Mu submodules to the new `release/*` branches
* Build platform and fix issues as discovered
  * Update individual Readme files with notes on changes required
  * Try to keep these notes associated with the correct repo. Example: if the platform requires a new PCD to build
    and this PCD is defined in `UefiCpuPkg`, update the `mu_basecore` Readme with a note about the platform decision
    (and ideally include recommendations)
* Once built, boot platform and fix issues as discovered
  * Update individual Readme files with notes on changes required

## 4) Change Default Branches

Once a reference platform successfully boots to Windows...

* Tag all repos as `*_RefBoot` and push tag to remotes
* Follow the steps in the [tutorial](https://msit.microsoftstream.com/video/2621a4ff-0400-9fb2-0956-f1eb0db01e45)
  [videos](https://msit.microsoftstream.com/video/65efa3ff-0400-9fb2-d666-f1eb0db4336f) to move the public and
  internal defaults

## 5) Update Security Repos

* Follow the steps in the [tutorial video](https://msit.microsoftstream.com/video/8f0fa1ff-0400-9fb2-2468-f1eb0a7c3087?list=studio)
  to update all current Security Patch repos

## 6) Announce Completion

* Use the `Release Announcements` channel in the Project Mu Team to announce completion
