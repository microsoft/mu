# Enhanced UEFI Memory Protection

## Background

While considerable attention has been devoted to hardware trust anchors and operating
system security, attackers have discovered that UEFI firmware is lacking basic memory
protection that has been present in other system software for over a decade. Coupled
with the inconsistency of security capabilities inherent to vendor firmware implementations,
UEFI firmware has become an increasingly attractive system attack vector. Exploiting
firmware vulnerabilities can be especially rewarding for an attacker because they can
compromise hypervisor-based technologies such as Virtualization Based Security (VBS)
and be used to establish boot kits that subvert antivirus and malware detection software
in the operating system.

In response to these security concerns, Microsoft is recommending all UEFI platform
vendors implement strict memory protections (these may become a requirement in the
future). This page describes the Enhanced Memory Protections that Microsoft is
recommending UEFI vendors implement.

These enhanced protections will cause some compatibility challenges, but the
more consistent our ecosystem is, the faster it will be to get the extensible
parts of our ecosystem aligned. The closing section in this document addresses
compatibility mitigations (Compatibility Mode) to handle non-compliant
modules during this transition period. It will take time for legacy code
to be updated to adhere to these new requirements and our collective commitment
to progress will pave the way to a more secure and resilient digital future.
**Project Mu serves as a reference implementation for Enhanced Memory Protections.**

## Condensed Requirements List

1: The UEFI 2.10 Memory Attribute Protocol must be produced.  
2: No address range can be simultaneously readable, writable, and executable.  
3: Unallocated memory must be marked EFI_MEMORY_RP or be unmapped.  
4: Address space which is not present in the Global Coherency Domain must cause a
CPU fault if accessed. This is a future requirement.
5: Calls to EFI_BOOT_SERVICES.AllocatePages and EFI_BOOT_SERVICES.AllocatePool
must return memory with the EFI_MEMORY_XP attribute.  
6: Page 0 in physical system memory must be marked EFI_MEMORY_RP or be unmapped.  
7: AP and BSP stacks must be marked EFI_MEMORY_XP.  
8: AP and BSP stacks must have an EFI_MEMORY_RP page at the bottom to catch overflow.  
9: MMIO ranges must be marked EFI_MEMORY_XP.  
10: Loaded image sections marked with the data characteristic must be EFI_MEMORY_XP.  
11: Loaded image sections the code characteristic must be EFI_MEMORY_RO.  
12: PE Loaders must check the NX_COMPAT flag of loaded images to determine
compatibility with the above memory protection requirements.  

## Runtime Configurable Protections

To enable memory protection in consumer shipped devices, runtime
configurability options need to be present to respond to edge cases
and accommodate non-compliant option ROMs. It is up to the platform
developer to determine what levers will be available and how faults are handled.

## Memory Attribute Protocol

A necessity for increasing the security posture is the availability of
the Memory Attribute Protocol. Added in UEFI Spec 2.10, the protocol
enables setting and getting EFI memory attributes in the UEFI environment.
Project Mu hosts an example implementation of this protocol.

## Exception Handling

Increasing the security posture of UEFI implementations will increase the
frequency of access violations. Exceptions should either cause a reset or
transition the memory protection state into compatibility mode. Platform
developers should also take care to ensure their exception handling logic
provides enough data to distinguish between fault types and root cause
failures. These access violations are often helpful for identifying programmer
errors and rooting out critical bugs before they become CVEs.

## Memory Management

### General Memory Management

![Example Compliant Memory Range](../img/memory_range.png)

At no point during boot should any addressable memory be readable, writable,
and executable. To reach this heightened security bar, all unallocated memory
should be marked EFI_MEMORY_RP or be unmapped. Addressable memory ranges which
are not present in the Global Coherency Domain should also be read-protected or
unmapped. When a module makes a call to allocate a buffer (even if that buffer
is of type EfiBootServicesCode, EfiRuntimeServicesCode, or EfiLoaderCode),
the returned page/pool must be non-executable. The module which called for the
allocation will be expected to utilize the Memory Attribute Protocol to
manipulate the attributes of the buffer to be either writable or executable
but not both.

#### Special Memory Ranges

* UEFI must apply EFI_MEMORY_RP to the NULL page or don't map it to help guard against NULL dereferences.
* AP and BSP stacks must be marked EFI_MEMORY_XP to prevent execution from the stack with
  a page marked EFI_MEMORY_RP at the base of the stack to prevent stack overflow.
* MMIO ranges should be marked EFI_MEMORY_XP.

## PE Loader

![Example of Loaded Image Ranges](../img/loaded_images.png)

On loading and prior to execution of an EFI image, the PE loader must apply
EFI_MEMORY_XP to sections marked with the data characteristic and EFI_MEMORY_RO
to sections marked with the code characteristic. Applying these page protections
requires loaded images to meet the following criteria:

1. Section flags must not combineâ€¯IMAGE_SCN_MEM_WRITE and IMAGE_SCN_MEM_EXECUTE for any
given section.
2. The PE image sections are aligned to page granularity.
3. The PE image must not contain any self-modifying code.

## NX_COMPAT Characteristic

Many bootloaders and OPROMs will not have implemented support for enhanced protections on
image memory, allocated buffers, and other memory ranges. To indicate support for enhanced
protections, the PE/COFF IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_NX_COMPAT DLL characteristic will be used.
Modules with this characteristic are expected to be compliant with enhanced memory protection
and should utilize the Memory Attribute Protocol to manipulate the attributes of memory they
allocate. If a module is loaded without this characteristic, the platform should enter
compatibility mode.

## Compatibility Mode

To provide a more consistent and predictable environment across UEFI implementations,
we are providing a definition for compatibility mode here. Errant modules and unexpected
faults blocking boot should enter compatibility mode which triggers the following
deviations from the enhanced memory protection definition:

1. All new memory allocated will be readable, writable, and executable.  
2. All images loaded from the start of compatibility mode will no longer have
restrictive access attributes applied to the memory ranges in which they are loaded.  
3. The Memory Attribute Protocol will be uninstalled.  
4. Page zero will be mapped.  
5. Legacy BIOS memory (the lower 640K range) will be mapped as readable, writable, and
executable.

### A Note on User Notification of Compatibility Mode

When a system is in compatibility mode, it is important that the user receives some
notification during boot which could take the form of a dialogue box, color bar, or
other visual indicator. At the start of this journey toward more strict memory
protections, we believe how compatibility mode is visualized should be left up to the
platform. In the future, platform developers should consider adding a TPM (Trusted
Platform Module) measurement when the system enters compatibility mode to have platform
enforcement of memory protections.

## Closing

It will take substantial work to update legacy code to adhere to these new security
standards. These protection mitigations offer significant value to end users by
heightening both real and perceived security, and to OEMs by reducing the number
of issues in the future. As we push toward updating incompatible modules, OEMs
should apply strict protections during product development which meet or exceed the
standard outlined in this document to help catch programmer error and reduce the
volume of unsafe firmware code entering the ecosystem. Microsoft is committed to
this effort and is prepared to work with partners as we move toward a more
secure UEFI ecosystem.
