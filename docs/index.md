# Welcome to Project Mu

![Greek Mu](img/project_mu.png)

Project Mu is a modular adaptation of TianoCore's [edk2](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2) tuned for building modern
devices using a scalable, maintainable, and reusable pattern.  Mu is built around the idea that shipping and
**maintaining** a UEFI product is an ongoing collaboration between numerous partners.  For too long, the industry has
built products using a "forking" model combined with copy/paste/rename and with each new product, the maintenance
burden grows to such a level that updates are near impossible due to cost and risk.

Project Mu also tries to address the complex business relationships and legal challenges facing partners today.  To
build most products,  it often requires both closed-source, proprietary assets as well as open-source and
industry-standard code.  The distributed build system and multi-repository design allow product teams to keep code
separate and connected to their original source while respecting legal and business boundaries.

Project Mu originated from building modern Windows PCs but its patterns and design allow it to be scaled down or up
for whatever the final product's intent.  IoT, Server, PC, or any other form factor should be able to leverage the
content.

## Primary Goals

Initially, this project will focus on two central goals.

### Share

We will share our active code tree to both solicit feedback and entice partners to collaborate.

Project Mu is an active project.  This is not a side project, mirror, clone, or example.  This is the same code used
today on many of Microsoft's 1st party devices and it will be kept current because it must be to continue to enable
shipping products.

### Support an industry shift to a more collaborative environment to lower costs and raise quality

We will use this project to promote, evangelize, and support an industry shift to a more collaborative environment
so that the entire ecosystem can develop and maintain products with lower costs and higher quality.

Today's open source projects, although extremely valuable, are very resource-intensive to interact with.  This friction
leads to major industry players avoiding public interaction, thus diminishing the overall communityâ€™s value.  The
modern era of open source projects has incorporated new tools and procedures to lower this friction and it is our goal
to leverage those tools.  GitHub provides issue tracking, Pull Requests, Gated builds, tracked/required web-based code
reviews, and CI/CD (Continuous integration and delivery).   It is our belief that by leveraging and extending this
automation and workflow, we can lower the friction and foster a safe place for all contributors to work.

## Guiding Principles

* Less is More [*](faq#is-this-really-following-less-is-more)
* Be open to change / flexible - Keep learning.  If it was easy this would have been solved before
* Design for code reuse
* Leverage tools / invest in automation

## Navigation

Have a look around this site to see what is Project Mu.  Start by reviewing the details of the community and our
process. See how to interact and get involved, why it's different, how to work within or extend it, as well as where
everything is located.  Finally, explore the [Developer Docs](DeveloperDocs\developer_docs.md) if you want to review
more in-depth details.

## Roadmap

After the first few months of Mu, our initial roadmap is largely complete. Any remaining items have been moved to the
GitHub Issues and will continue to be tracked there. We hope to use GitHub Issues to track new roadmap items going
forwards.
